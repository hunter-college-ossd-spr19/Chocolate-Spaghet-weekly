*Some* information about me!

### More Information

**Hello!**

My name is Andrey Shtukenberg and I am a junior Computer Science major at [CUNY Hunter College](http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/main/). I am expecting to graduate in May 2020 hopefully with a Math minor as well as the Computer Science major. I am interested in all things Computer Science, and have explored the full stack of web development with both .NET and React-Express Javascript maddness. Even though I feel like Javascript is a messy language and *should never be used*, so far I have had a better experience with it than Microsoft's implementation. All of these endeavors can be seen on my [actual github account](https://github.com/Fioringo). I currently have a live demo of [Myce](http://myce.link.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/about/about.html) running, a website designed to show real Department of Health ratings on certain restaurants in New York City. It was deployed using [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) during the hackathon when it was created, and a big update is coming soon to its looks and functionality. I have another big project getting deployed soon, so it will appear here instead of this sentence.

**A little about my interest in Computer Science...**
I got interestd in Computer Science from an early age. Over the years I wanted to explore more ways of human interaciton with computers, and seeing VR and AR technologies progress was very exciting. The hardware is nice, but it is better complemented by software, and I think it would be fun to write some of it.

*This is it for now.*
