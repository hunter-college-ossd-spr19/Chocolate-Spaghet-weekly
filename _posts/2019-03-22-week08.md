### Open Source Project Updates #1

**Hello!**

This week I have been working on OSNY, and I have made a pretty terrible pull request. Apparently I have missed a few READMEs and they had the prevous project name in there. I also missed a couple of documentation point I didn't realize needed documenting. Apparently the boilerplate required `nodemon` and `concurrently` to be installed globally (`npm i -g nodemon concurrently`). This problem appeared before, but I haven't paid much attention since it worked well on my computer (which is not a very good thing on my part). I am in the progress of fixing that and a few other problems with the boilerplate and will make a pull request then.

That is it for this week!
