### What's needed for contributions

**Hello**,

This week we had to find out what was important to know in order to be able to contribute to an open source project. One of the main things that I think you need to know in order to contribute, and something I really have to work on, is code reading and understanding what I've read. This skill is very important if one wants to do coding with other people, and I hope to do that.

Another thing that may be important is proper documentation. So far, my documentation of code has been variable with how much time I'm spending on writing the code. I'm not saying that I'm not doing it, I'm saying that there's imporvement to be had in that area. Open source projects are especially sensitive to that, so that would be something I would need to improve.

>Thank you for reading!
